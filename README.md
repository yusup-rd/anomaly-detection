# Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection 

## Anomaly Detection Using Moving Average and Standard Deviation: Algorithm Explanation

### Overview
The chosen method for detecting anomalies in the continuous data stream is based on a **Moving Average** and **Standard Deviation** approach. This method is widely used for its simplicity and effectiveness in identifying outliers in time series data.

### Algorithm Description
1. **Moving Average**: The moving average smooths the data by averaging a specified number of previous data points (the window size). This helps mitigate noise and allows us to observe underlying trends in the data.
  
2. **Standard Deviation**: For each moving average value, calculated the standard deviation of the data points within the same window. The standard deviation provides a measure of how much the data varies from the mean within that window.

3. **Anomaly Detection**: An anomaly is flagged if the difference between the current data point and the moving average exceeds a predefined threshold (in terms of standard deviations). This means that if a data point deviates significantly from the expected value (i.e., the moving average), it is considered an anomaly.

### Rationale for Choosing This Algorithm
- **Simplicity**: The moving average and standard deviation approach is straightforward to implement and understand. This is particularly useful for quick prototypes and clear visualizations.
  
- **Adaptability**: It can easily adapt to changes in the data (concept drift) by adjusting the window size. Larger windows smooth the data more but may miss short-term anomalies, while smaller windows are more sensitive to changes.

- **Interpretability**: The results are easy to interpret, as we can visually see how the moving average and thresholds interact with the data points.

### Limitations of Other Methods
While there are various algorithms for anomaly detection, I chose not to implement them for the following reasons:

1. **Isolation Forest**: Although effective for high-dimensional data, this algorithm requires more computational resources and is not as straightforward to visualize in real-time scenarios.

2. **Statistical Tests (e.g., Z-score)**: These can be sensitive to the underlying distribution of data. If the data is not normally distributed, these tests might yield misleading results. Our approach provides a more flexible framework that is robust against variations.

3. **Machine Learning Approaches (e.g., Neural Networks)**: While these methods can provide high accuracy, they require extensive training data and parameter tuning, making them less suitable for quick implementations and real-time analysis.

4. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Some methods utilize dynamic thresholds based on historical data patterns. However, these can be complex to implement and interpret, and they may not perform well in rapidly changing environments.

## Conclusion
The moving average and standard deviation method strikes a balance between complexity and effectiveness for real-time anomaly detection in data streams. Its interpretability and adaptability make it a strong choice for this application, particularly in environments where quick implementation and responsiveness are crucial.
